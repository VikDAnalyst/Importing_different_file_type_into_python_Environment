üêç Importing Different File Types into Python Environment

üìò Project Overview:

This project demonstrates how to import various file formats into the Python environment for data analysis and exploration.
It serves as a practical guide for data analysts and researchers who frequently work with datasets from multiple sources and formats.

The notebook covers the importation of files commonly used in data science, including CSV, Excel, JSON, TXT, SQL, STATA, and SAS files.
